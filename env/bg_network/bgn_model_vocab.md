v: denoting membrane voltages
h, n, r, c: gating variables -- 
  represent the degree of opening of a certain ion channel.
 membrane capacitance: q=CV, ie.
      ratio of charge on a conductor to electric potential difference.
      

 Joules: J, energy: force x distance
 Coulomb: base unit of charge. If the current in a circuit is 1 ampere,
      then 1 coulomb of charge passes a point in the circuit every second.
        (ie: 1A = 1C/s)
      $Q = 12\muC$
      $Q = n * e$, 
           n: number of electrons, 
           e: 1.6x10^{-19}C : charge on an electron & a proton.
 Current (I):  I = Q/t

 voltage/potential: the amount of work energy needed to move a unit of electric 
      charge from a reference point to the specific point in the electric field
  ie, the amount of energy (J) received by 1C of electrons as it passes through 
  a point in electric field.
  V = K Q/r ... r is distance to field point, Q is charge source, k=9*10^9 Nm^2/C^2
      recall, newton (N) is the unit of force 1kg m/2^2. 
      mass of 1 kg an acceleration of 1m/s^2
 Note that voltage is $\Delta V$ between two points in space. Whereas 
  V (electric potential) is energy received per coulomb at one location in the field.

 Capacitor: two pieces of separated conducting material that store charge.
      negative charge is attracted to positive terminal of battery and repelled
      from negative terminal of a battery 
  (Eventually, the force of attraction to battery positive terminal will equal 
   the force of attraction to positive end of capacitor.)
 Capacitance: the ability of a system to store electric charge.
  C = Q / V, where V is the voltage across the capacitor.
